# Bus-pass-website
     Students, office workers or people who use City buses for daily commute require a convenient platform for purchasing bus passes. This portal will provide all the information necessary to apply for bus passes and will generate a bus pass token that can be used for everyday commute. The bus pass reservation system aims to digitalize the process of issuing bus passes while maintaining organized user records to provide relevant offers and discounts on the passes. 
The application will provide information on bus routes, bus pass rates and different offers available. It will aid in compiling the required details and documents for issuing student passes and will keep track of the passes issued and its expiration dates. Apart from being environment friendly, a digital pass will minimize cost overheads and will make the application process less tedious. It also solves the issue of bus passes being misplaced or stolen and allows users to renew passes easily.
